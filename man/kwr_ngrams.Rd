\title{Generates n-grams from queries}
\usage{
kwr_ngrams(
  x,
  max_words = 4,
  min_words = 1,
  min_n = 1,
  min_volume = 0,
  remove_nested = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link{kwresearch}} object, which queries will be n-grams
calculated from, or a data frame of queries and volume.}

\item{max_words}{Maximum number of words in n-grams.}

\item{min_words}{Minimum number of words in n-grams.}

\item{min_n}{Minimum number of queries. Only the n-grams with at least this
number of queries will be included.}

\item{min_volume}{Minimum search volume per n-gram. Only the n-grams with at
least this volume will be included.}

\item{remove_nested}{If TRUE, n-grams fully contained in another n-gram
(number of queries must be the same) are filtered out from the result. May
be slower.}
}
\value{
A tibble of n-grams with a basic stats (number of queries and sum of
search volumes). The n-grams are ordered descendingly by number of queries
and search volume. Use dplyr::arrange to change order. If stop words are
set with the kwr_use_stopwords, they are removed from unigrams.
